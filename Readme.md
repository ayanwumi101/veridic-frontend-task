# link to live webapp is 

# The first thing i did was I went through the instructions for the task and i made sure i understood it. 

# After that, i created a react project using vite and then installed the dependencies and some other packages like axios for data fetching and i also used chakra Ui to build the UI to make my work faster. 

# I made sure i spltted the code into reuseable components and and then pass data between them using props. 

# I made sure the errors were handled correctly if anything goes wrong while fetching the data. 

# Also i made sure a loader is being displayed when the data is being fetched. 

# I also made sure the website is fully responsive on all devices. I t was a nice project for me to work on, i look forward to more complex tasks in the future,
